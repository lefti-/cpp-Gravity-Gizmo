What?
-----
This repo contains Gravity Gizmo. This is a game I originally developed in Python and Pygame.
I am going to re-program the game in C++, using GEngine. NOTE: In very early stages of development.

- GEngine is a 2D game engine, based on SDL2 and OpenGL
- SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) is used for handling input, audio, windowing and text
- OpenGL is used for rendering graphics

Project:
---------
- Sidescrolling platformer, where quick reactions are a must
- Graphics created in Paint.net
- Uses GEngine from cpp-GEngine
- Uses the project from cpp-GEngine/platformer-demo as the basic template
- In early stages of development

How to download?
----------------
I will occasionally upload a most latest version of the game.
You have to download the game binary, assets and required .dll's. I bundled them all in one 563KB .zip file.
This .zip file contains the executable in the bin directory.

- Navigate to the folder "bin" on top of the site
  1. Click the file "gravity_gizmo.zip", and on the right click the button labeled "Raw"
- This downloads the .zip file

NOTE: Currently only tested on Windows!

How to play?
------------
Press A, D or Left, Right arrow keys to move. Spacebar to jump.
